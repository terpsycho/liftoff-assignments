## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to make a website where writers can sumbit their short stories, flash fiction, and novellas to be read and responded to by other writers. I want it to have a merit and a point system in place as well as comment sections, suggested edits, and various other functions that help cultivate better writers and readers. I want to also have a blog functionality which links to several other writing sites for reference, shows upcoming writing competitions, and gives tips and tricks of the industry. I'd like there to be a sort of social media type function to the site as well, which would allow for private inboxing. I also want to encourage writers to profit off their work, so I would like the authors to be able to lonk their Patreon or PayPal or Amazon accounts... so they could generate revenue if they so desired.

### Technologies
Ideally, I'd like to use Ruby/Ruby on Rails to build and Heroku to host, maybe MySQL as th database, but I need to do research on it as this may be too ambitious.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I need to learn Ruby (which I have already been doing) and Rails and how Heroku works too.
